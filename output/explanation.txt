A machine is simply a tool. It is designed to help us do work. Machines make tasks easier or faster. They help us move heavy things. They can also perform complex actions repeatedly.

Every machine needs power to run. This power is called the energy input. Energy can come from many places. A lawnmower uses gasoline. A computer uses electricity. A bicycle uses the power from your muscles. The machine cannot work without this input energy.

Inside the machine are many different parts. These parts are called components. They work together in a specific way. Think of gears, wheels, belts, and levers. These components are the heart of the machine.

The components manage the input energy. They transfer force from one place to another. They often change the direction of the force. For example, gears can increase speed or increase strength. A lever helps you lift something heavy with less effort. The machine is designed to use these parts to modify the force.

Finally, the machine performs a useful action. This is the work output. A washing machine spins clothes clean. A crane lifts steel beams high into the air. The machine converts the input energy into the desired output work.

All machines follow this basic rule. Energy goes in. Components process the energy and force. Useful work comes out. This process saves us time and effort every day.
