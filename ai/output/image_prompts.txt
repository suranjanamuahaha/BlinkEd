IMAGE 1:
Clear, textbook-style illustration of water discharging from a tank through an orifice, emphasizing the narrowing fluid jet (vena contracta).

IMAGE 2:
Clear cartoon illustration of a large water tank showing a small orifice hole controlling the fluid flow. Landscape, smooth lines.

IMAGE 3:
Educational cartoon of a clean, perfect stream of fluid exiting a simple tank, demonstrating maximum theoretical flow.

IMAGE 4:
Educational cross-section diagram of water exiting an orifice. Clearly show the fluid stream narrowing (vena contracta) and subtle friction lines near the hole's inner edges.

IMAGE 5:
A wide, textbook illustration comparing the large calculated theoretical fluid flow volume to the smaller actual flow volume exiting a simple pipe.

IMAGE 6:
Textbook illustration of fluid flow through an orifice plate in a pipe. Contrast the ideal, straight flow calculation with the actual, contracted flow (vena contracta).

IMAGE 7:
Textbook cross-section of an orifice plate in a pipe. Illustrate the fluid jet contraction (vena contracta) comparing actual flow area to the orifice opening.

IMAGE 8:
Simple textbook illustration comparing theoretical 100% fluid flow from a nozzle versus the actual 60% flow, showing friction loss.

IMAGE 9:
**Textbook illustration of an engineer checking a simple flow meter installed in a wide pipe, highlighting the flow coefficient calculation.**
