A machine is simply a tool. It helps us do work. Machines make difficult tasks easier. They also make slow tasks much faster. Think about a bicycle or a computer. Both are machines. They all work using the same basic steps.

Every machine needs energy. Energy is the power source. Without energy, the machine cannot move or function. Energy can come from many places. A car uses gasoline. A blender uses electricity. Your muscles provide energy for a shovel or a simple lever. This energy makes the machine ready to work.

Next, the machine needs an input. Input is the instruction or material you give the machine. When you type on a keyboard, that is input. When you load dirty dishes into a dishwasher, that is input.

Once the machine has energy and input, it starts the process. The process is the actual work the machine does. The machine changes the input into something useful. A lawnmower uses its process to turn gasoline energy into sharp blades spinning quickly. A computer uses its process to turn keyboard clicks into words on a screen.

The final step is the output. Output is the result of the machine’s work. The output of the lawnmower is cut grass. The output of the dishwasher is clean dishes.

In short, a machine takes energy and input. It uses a specific process to create a useful output. This simple cycle explains how almost every machine, from a simple wheelbarrow to a complex robot, gets the job done.
