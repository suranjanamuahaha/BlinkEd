A machine is a tool. It helps us do work easily. Think of a simple machine first. A lever is a simple machine. A seesaw is a lever. You push down on one side. The other side goes up. You move a heavy object with less effort. That is how a simple machine works.

Complex machines are made of many simple parts. A car is a complex machine. So is a computer. These machines work by using energy. Energy makes the machine move or change things.

Most machines use electricity. Electricity is a form of energy. It flows through wires. It powers the machine’s parts. A motor is a key part of many machines. The motor takes electrical energy. It turns that energy into movement. This movement does the work.

Machines also use mechanical parts. Gears are common parts. Gears are wheels with teeth. They fit together. When one gear turns, it makes the next gear turn. This transfers the movement and force.

A machine takes an input. The input is the energy or force you put in. It then processes this input. Finally, it gives an output. The output is the useful work done. For example, a washing machine takes electrical energy (input). It spins clothes (process). It gives you clean laundry (output). Machines make our lives much easier. They multiply our effort.
