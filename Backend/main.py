"""
Legacy FastAPI application (archived).

This repository now uses the Django auth backend by default. The previous
FastAPI application is preserved only as an archived placeholder. It is
intentionally inert so development environments without FastAPI and related
dependencies do not show unresolved-import errors.

Remove or restore this file only if you intend to run the FastAPI backend.
